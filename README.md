# adaptable-components

## what is this?
Adaptable Components is a library of components that are configurable from a web-app. This allows you to create a component once and use it in multiple places with different configurations. the reason we chose this method is because a lot of the time component libraries require you to customize them with code after you have installed them, while other tools take a similar approach to ours, we wanted to create a library that was easy to use and easy to customize. The most important thing is that it is adaptable for every project you use it in. This is why we just let you copy the css.

## how do i use it?
You do not need to install anything thats the fun part! All you need to do is go to the webApp choose a component and configure it to your liking. Once you are done you can copy the code and paste it into your project.

## why not use a component library?
Component libraries are great, but they are not always easy to customize. We wanted to create a library that was easy to use and easy to customize. while also not having to install anything. this also makes it easier to purge the styles you do not want because all this is in the end is just css/scss.

## how do i contribute?
at the moment we are not accepting contributions, this is mainly because we are still in school and we treat this like a side project. we may accept contributions if we are successfull in creating this in the first place and once we have more time to work on this. school is our main priority at the moment. Please feel free to create an issue if you find a bug or have a feature request.
